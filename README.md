## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**:

   - Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8765`

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The app will automatically detect your Homebrew installation
   - If Homebrew needs updating, you'll see an "Update Homebrew" button
   - Click it to update Homebrew's package database

### Main Interface

The application has four main tabs:

#### üì¶ Packages Tab
- **Outdated Packages**: View and upgrade packages that have newer versions available
- **All Installed Packages**: Browse, search, and manage all installed packages
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple packages for batch upgrades

#### üóëÔ∏è Orphaned Tab
- View packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed
- These can be safely uninstalled to free up space

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated Tab
- See packages that are deprecated or disabled
- Get information about why they're deprecated and alternatives

#### üîç Search Tab
- Search for new packages to install
- Browse formulae and casks with descriptions
- Install packages directly from search results

### Common Operations

#### Updating Homebrew
- Click the "Update Homebrew" button in the header when available
- This updates Homebrew's package database

#### Upgrading Packages
1. **Individual Upgrade**: Click the upgrade button next to any outdated package
2. **Bulk Upgrade**: 
   - Select multiple packages using checkboxes
   - Click "Upgrade Selected" to upgrade all at once
3. **Upgrade All**: Use the bulk selection to upgrade all outdated packages

#### Installing New Packages
1. Go to the Search tab
2. Enter the package name in the search box
3. Browse results and click "Install" on desired packages

#### Uninstalling Packages
- Click the uninstall button next to any installed package
- Confirm the action in the dialog

### Sudo Operations

Some operations require administrator privileges:

1. **Automatic Detection**: The app detects when sudo is needed
2. **Current Workaround**: When sudo is required, enter your password in the terminal where you launched the application
3. **Future Enhancement**: In-app sudo password handling is planned (see TODO section)

### Activity Panel

The activity panel (bottom-right) shows:
- Real-time operation logs
- Success/error messages
- Progress updates for long-running operations

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Set the port number (default: 8765)
  ```bash
  PORT=8080 python3 server.py
  ```

### Custom Homebrew Path

The application automatically detects Homebrew installations in common locations:
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` (Apple Silicon Macs)
- `/usr/local/bin/brew` (Intel Macs)
- `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew` (Linux)

If Homebrew is installed elsewhere, ensure it's in your `PATH`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Python 3.7+ with built-in HTTP server
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS
- **Communication**: RESTful API with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- **Package Management**: Direct integration with Homebrew CLI

### API Endpoints

The application provides a REST API for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/health` - Check Homebrew status
- `GET /api/summary` - Get overview of all packages
- `GET /api/outdated` - List outdated packages
- `GET /api/installed` - List all installed packages
- `GET /api/search?q=<query>` - Search for packages
- `POST /api/install` - Install a package
- `POST /api/uninstall` - Uninstall a package
- `POST /api/upgrade` - Upgrade packages

### Streaming Operations

Long-running operations use Server-Sent Events for real-time feedback:
- `GET /api/update_stream` - Stream Homebrew update progress
- `GET /api/upgrade_stream` - Stream package upgrade progress
- `GET /api/install_stream` - Stream package installation progress

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Homebrew not found" Error**:
   - Ensure Homebrew is installed and in your PATH
   - Try running `brew --version` in terminal to verify

2. **Permission Errors**:
   - Some operations require sudo privileges
   - Enter your password in the terminal where you launched the application when prompted

3. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Change the port: `PORT=8080 python3 server.py`
   - Or kill the existing process using the port

4. **Python Not Found**:
   - Install Python 3.7+: `brew install python`
   - Ensure `python3` command is available

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, you can run with verbose output:
```bash
python3 -u server.py 2>&1 | tee homebrew-manager.log
```
